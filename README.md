    * chicago.csv - Bikeshare data for Chicago
    * new_york_city.csv - Bikeshare data for NYC
    * washington.csv - Bikeshare data for Washington DC

    Each data file contains the following columns:
    * Start Time
    * End Time
    * Trip Duration
    * Start Station
    * End Station
    * User Type
    * Gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    * Birth Year (only available for NYC and Chicago)
